unwanted_metas 2.0

This plugin prevents images from selected albums from displaying in the meta albums.

The "meta" albums are the dynamically created albums like Random, Last updated, etc.

After installation you can multi select (usually with the control key) all of the albums
you wish to exclude. Then click "submit".

You can return to the plugin manager page and modify the albums you would like the plugin
to restrict.

This is a self contained plugin and no longer requires any mod to displayimage.php.

Support is available on the cpg-contrib.com forum http://cpg-contrib.org/board/index.php?board=31.0
